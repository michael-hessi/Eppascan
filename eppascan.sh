# Eppascan â€“ Epson Scanner Integration for Paperless-NGX, v0.1
#
# A service for a headless Paperless-NGX server that waits for the scan 
# button on any networked Epson scanner to be pressed, to then 
# automatically start a scan process and transfer the documents to the 
# Paperless consume directory.
#
# Listens for Epson scanner broadcast and automatically scans all pages 
# to /opt/paperless/consume

# Network interface to listen on for IGMP packets (e.g., "eth0", "enp3s0")

# Multicast address used by Epson scanners for IGMP broadcast discovery
MULTICAST_ADDR="239.255.255.253"

# Delay (in seconds) after detecting the scanner before starting the scan
# Useful to give the scanner time to initialize after waking up
SCAN_INITIAL_DELAY=15

# Maximum duration (in seconds) allowed for a scan operation before it is forcefully stopped
SCAN_TIMEOUT=300

# Scan resolution in DPI (dots per inch)
# 300 is a good compromise between quality and file size for OCR

# "Gray" is usually sufficient for documents/receipts

# Paperless will later convert these images into PDF/A
