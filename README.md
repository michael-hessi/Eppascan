## About

**Eppascan** is an open-source solution for seamless integration of Epson network scanners (tested with ES-500WII) with [Paperless-NGX](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx).  
It consists of a daemon script that automates scanning and an installation script for easy setup as a systemd service.  
Once installed, scan operations triggered on the scanner are automatically detected, and scanned documents are saved directly into the Paperless-NGX consume directory.

---

**Version:** v0.2 (2025-08-08)

---

## Changelog / Changes in version v0.2

- Improved network detection through relaxed IGMP packet checking  
- Improved error handling and detailed logging with timestamps  
- Timeout feature for scanning processes introduced (default: 300 seconds)  
- Secure cleanup of temporary files with cleanup mechanism via trap  
- Removal of the no longer needed `MULTICAST_ADDR` variable  
- More stable scanner IP detection and more robust overall structure of the script  
- Adjustment of the scan command and the output path structure  

---

## Features

- Listens for Epson scanner broadcasts on the local network  
- Automatically starts duplex scans from the ADF when a scan is triggered  
- Saves scanned files directly to `/opt/paperless/consume` for Paperless-NGX processing  
- Runs as a systemd service for background operation and autostart  
- Detailed logging for status and error diagnosis  

---

## Requirements

- Epson network scanner (tested: ES-500WII; others may work)  
- Linux server (Debian/Ubuntu recommended)  
- [Paperless-NGX](https://github.com/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx) installed and configured  
- Network access between scanner and server (same subnet, multicast enabled)  
- Root privileges for installation  

---

## Installation

Clone the repository and run the installer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/michael-hessi/Eppascan.git
cd Eppascan
chmod +x eppascan_install.sh
./eppascan_install.sh
```

The installer will:

- Install required packages (`tcpdump`, `sane-utils`)  
- Copy the main script to `/usr/local/bin/`  
- Create and enable the systemd service  
- Set appropriate permissions  

---

## Configuration

Before installation, you may edit variables in `eppascan.sh` as needed:

| Variable             | Description                                  | Example Value            |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `NETWORK_INTERFACE`  | Network interface                            | `eth0`                   |
| `SCAN_OUTPUT_DIR`    | Output directory                             | `/opt/paperless/consume`|
| `SCAN_RESOLUTION`    | Scan resolution (dpi)                        | `300`                    |
| `SCAN_MODE`          | Scan mode (Color, Gray, Lineart)             | `Gray`                   |
| `SCAN_FORMAT`        | Output file format                           | `jpeg`                   |

> ðŸ’¡ For best OCR results, use at least 300 dpi and grayscale mode.

## Usage

1. Load documents into the scanner's ADF  
2. Wake up the scanner and ensure it is connected to the network  
3. Press the scan button  
4. Wait approximately 15 seconds (the scanner searches for Epson Scan 2 software; this delay is normal)  
5. The scan will start automatically; all pages in the ADF will be processed and saved to `/opt/paperless/consume`  

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Check logs:**

```bash
tail -n 50 /var/log/eppascan_scanimage_errors.log
```

- **Verify multicast traffic:**

```bash
tcpdump -i eth0 igmp
```

- **Check firewall/network:**  
  Ensure UDP ports `3289`, `3702` and TCP ports `1865`, `445` are open.

- **Test SANE backend:**

```bash
scanimage -L
```

- **Check directory permissions:**

```bash
chown -R paperless:paperless /opt/paperless/consume
```

- **Ensure the eppascan service runs with sufficient permissions**  
  to access the scanner and write to the output directory.

- **Check Paperless logs:**

```bash
journalctl -u paperless-consumer -f
```
